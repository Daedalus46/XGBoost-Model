# EV RANGE PREDICTOR-Model

A simple end-to-end machine-learning project demonstrating data preprocessing, training an XGBoost model, model evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit Cloud.

This repository includes:
- Data processing scripts
- Model training notebook / script
- The `app.py` Streamlit application
- Deployment instructions
- A working deployed demo link

## 🧠 About the Model

This project uses XGBoost, a powerful gradient-boosting algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.

The workflow includes:
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Feature engineering
3. Train-test splitting
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Training the XGBoost model
6. Saving the model with pickle
7. Building a Streamlit interface for inference
